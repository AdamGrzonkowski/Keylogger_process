# Keylogger_process - naive and quick implementation
Simple keylogger hidden as an explorer process. Hides its application window, which makes it invisible. In processes hides itself as explorer.
Works for Windows7, because of filepath - saves results to "C:\\Temp\\". Can be made multi-OS if checking for folder existance is done.
